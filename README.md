# Covid-19-system-in-Malaysia
This will be a simple simulation system for counting the cases in Malaysia


The coding can be change at the states using for loops if we want to use other countries . 
It is easy if we use for loops rather than put all the states in one array .
This programme also as an example for array beginner like me .

Covid Data = The real simulation to key in the Covid-19 Data which can be used in all countries 
Covid_19 = This system only can be used only in Malaysia
