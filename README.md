# Covid-19-system-in-Malaysia
This will be a simulation system for counting the cases in Malaysia


The coding can be change at the states using for loops if we want to use other countries . 
It is easy if we use for loops rather than put all the states in one array .
This programme also as an example for array beginner like me .
